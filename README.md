**interests** - forest genomics • local adaptation • quantitative traits • population genetics • python


Hello, World! 👋 I'm currently a Research Fellow at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/#_ga=2.33693667.351142198.1686237709-830092438.1686237708) with [Katie Lotterhos]() using simulated data to assess machine learning methods for ranking population risk to climate change. I was formerly at the [University of British Columbia](https://fcs.forestry.ubc.ca) with [Sally Aitken](https://twitter.com/SallyNAitken) and [Sam Yeaman](https://twitter.com/sam_yeaman) working on the [CoAdapTree project](http://coadaptree.forestry.ubc.ca) to assist four ecologically and economically important Canadian conifer species adapt in the face of changing climates.

I've created several custom python functions for everyday use - eg using engines to parallelize reading in of large dataframes, submit/query/update slurm jobs and slurm queue, creating basic maps, and more - check out my repo [here](https://github.com/brandonlind/pythonimports)

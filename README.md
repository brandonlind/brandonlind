# Brandon Lind,  Ph.D. - Integrative Life Sciences
**interests** - forest genomics • local adaptation • quantitative traits • population genetics • python


Hello, World! 👋 I'm currently a Research Fellow at the [University of British Columbia](https://fcs.forestry.ubc.ca) with [Sally Aitken](https://twitter.com/SallyNAitken) and [Sam Yeaman](https://twitter.com/sam_yeaman) working on the [CoAdapTree project](http://coadaptree.forestry.ubc.ca). We're working on genomics-based approaches to assist four conifer species important to Canadian forestry adapt in the face of changing climates, and we are (or will be) sharing every single line of code! Check out our [GitHub page](https://www.github.com/coadaptree)!

I've created several custom python functions for everyday use - eg using engines to parallelize reading in of large dataframes, submit/query/update slurm jobs, creating basic maps, and more - check out my repo [here](https://github.com/brandonlind/pythonimports)
